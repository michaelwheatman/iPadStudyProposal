	School districts across the country have begun implementing new policies regarding the role of technology in the classroom. Many schools have started providing tablet computers to all students and encouraging the use of these relatively novel devices throughout the educational experience. Questions that educators and parents will have to address are "Are we confident that tablets provide an improved educational experience compared to traditional teaching methods?" and "Will the use of expensive tablet computers in education continue to drive a wedge between the opportunities for academic achievement for the rich and the poor?" Furthermore, what role in the educational process should technologically advanced devices play and when, if ever, is too young for a child to use a tablet computer.
	In discussions with early childhood education specialists, it has become clear that "the screen" can seem like an evil whose influence on a child's development must be limited (personal interview with Sarah Kaul and Mary - 3/9/2015). The claim is that during early childhood development, before the age of 5, the primary role of the child is learning to socialize with peers and adults. They argue that while the tablet may be entertaining for the child or a helpful distraction to enable the parent or provider a measure of free time it does not provide the same benefits to the child's development as direct personal interaction.
	The claim that children do not benefit from "the screen" is dubious. For example, experiments comparing children who reportedly watched educational television programming such as sesame street  

	For my final project, I intend to propose a study of the educational benefits and drawbacks of tablet computers. During the past decade, tablet computers have experienced a transition from reshaped personal computers to smaller, lighter, and cheaper devices running stripped down operating systems to allow for easier and more responsive interaction. There is anecdotal and scholarly evidence of very young children intuitively understanding how to use the touchscreen to interact with the device as an extension of their regular environment (Couse & Chen, 2010; Matthews & Jessel, 1993). Children are able to easily navigate the touch interfaces of these iPads and Android devices, rapidly becoming more comfortable with the new technology than their parents. Making education more entertaining for young children can lead to more equal opportunity and greater academic success in the future and thus it is important to study ways of increasing learning in early childhood (Ramani & Siegler, 2011).
	Because of their small size and weight, as well as the fast response to input, tablets are well suited for children to interact with as a part of their environment. I am interested in studying what kind of benefits children can experience by using tablets and education specific applications. In addition, I believe that there may be some serious issues that may require further thought before giving a child a tablet and directing them to a vocabulary (or some other educational) app.
	To investigate the benefits of tablets and educational apps the study would involve a series of experiments where children in different conditions would be directed to play with a virtual and/or a physical educational tool. I can foresee conditions where children are directed to different types of educational activities, such as mathematics, vocabulary, or musical flashcards for example, via a virtual application or physical cards. The children would then take some kind of test to determine how well they learned the information presented. In addition, there should also be conditions where the child is allowed to spend as much time as they like preparing (or studying) to determine whether there is some preference, measured by time spent on the task, toward either kind of interaction.
	It is important that the test protocol not favor any input type condition. Thus, it may be reasonable to test children on the same or opposite method as their preparation. Alternatively, some other tool, verbal quizzing with drawings on a blackboard for instance, could alleviate some concerns about practice effects.
The study could turn up a variety of outcomes. 
•	Children could learn better from the tablet (or the reverse).
•	Children could learn more efficiently from the tablet but prefer to spend more time with the physical cards (or the reverse) so the results show similar total learning effectiveness.
	In addition, it is important to observe how children interact with the different input types. Do they like to spread flash cards around, thus incorporating some visual-spatial organization into their encoding of the knowledge. This is a limitation of electronic devices that could hamper their usefulness.
	One of the studies that I've looked at performed an ergonomic analysis of children using tablets. They found that while using the computer, the children tended to have poor posture, spinal alignment, and shoulder position. However, they noted that this position was similar to that that children assumed while playing with paper (Straker et al., 2008). 
	This study incorporates many concepts addressed in this course. For example, attention and memory are studied directly as well as other topics such as executive functioning and goal setting via the self-timed conditions.
