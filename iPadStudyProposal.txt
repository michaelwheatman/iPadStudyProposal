	School districts across the country have begun implementing new policies regarding the role of technology in the classroom. Many schools have started providing tablet computers to all students and encouraging the use of these relatively novel devices throughout the educational experience. Questions that educators and parents will have to address are "Are we confident that tablets provide an improved educational experience compared to traditional teaching methods?" and "Will the use of expensive tablet computers in education continue to drive a wedge between the opportunities for academic achievement for the rich and the poor?" Furthermore, what role in the educational process should technologically advanced devices play and when, if ever, is too young for a child to use a tablet computer.
	In discussions with early childhood education specialists, it has become clear that "the screen" can seem like an evil whose influence on a child's development must be limited (personal interview with Sarah Kaul and Mary Loven- 3/9/2015). The claim is that during early childhood development, before the age of 5, the primary role of the child is learning to socialize with peers and adults. They argue that while the tablet may be entertaining for the child or a helpful distraction to enable the parent or provider a measure of free time it does not provide the same benefits to the child's development as direct personal interaction. 
	Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that "television and other entertainment media should be avoided for infants and children under age 2." However, those same guidelines also note that for slightly older children, controlled access to technology can promote media literacy  (Media and Children. 2012, April 7. Retrieved March 10, 2015, from https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Pages/Media-and-Children.aspx?). 
	The claim that children do not gain any benefit from "the screen" is dubious. For example, experiments comparing children who reportedly watched educational television programming such as sesame street have found that increased viewing between the ages of 3 and 4 was significantly correlated with improved vocabulary two years older (Rice, Huston...). The authors hypothesized that this improvement was due to the high degree of attention that children devoted to the television while watching. 
	In another study of children's habits regarding Sesame Street viewing and attention, experimenters noted that younger children were more drawn to toys and connecting with their mothers while older children were able to pay attention to the television for much greater periods of time (Anderson and Levin). The fact that young children seem to intuitively seek physical and social interaction should comfort those who fear that children placed in front of televisions are doomed to live a life totally lacking in interpersonal interaction. Both of these findings seem to provide support for the positive benefits to cognitive development, both in semantic knowledge and attention, that one sided interaction between a child and a technological screen can provide.
	"Screens" have been shown to provide some extremely positive effects on social behavior for preschool aged children. In one study, children's interactions were observed before and after one week of exposure to either Sesame Street or Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The authors' surprising findings showed childrens' frequency of giving positive reinforcement to peers increased significantly after the exposure. Interestingly, there was a difference in the ability of the programming to improve the children's behavior. Whereas Sesame Street only improved the interactions of children who had initially scored low during the baseline observation, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was successful at increasing positive reinforcement and social contact among all children (Coates, Pusser, Goodman). Children are clearly able to gain significant social and behavioral skills from individual interaction with the television perhaps assuaging some of parents' guilt or fear regarding children's screen use. 
	Interestingly, in a recent British study of 11,000 children, researchers found that watching TV for greater than three hours predicted a slight increase of conduct problems. They did not specify the kind of television that the children were watching. Additionally, they found that children's interactions with electronic games did not correlate with any of the ill effects (Parkes, Sweeting, Wight...). This provides additional evidence that children will not experience behavioral harm as a result of interaction with tablet computers and educational games or apps.
	Making education more entertaining for young children can lead to more equal opportunity and greater academic success in the future and thus it is important to study ways of increasing learning in early childhood (Ramani & Siegler, 2011). It is important to discuss the varying impact that interaction with technology will have on children of different family income backgrounds. Tablet computers are expensive and there is a risk that any benefits that they could provide to child development will be solely enjoyed by those parents or schools that can afford them. As a child's family's income is a huge predictor of that child's future achievement, there is a risk of increasing social division between the "haves" and the "have-nots". 
	Television has been a powerful educational aide to children across economic divisions. The vocabulary study discussed above found that the attention and vocabulary benefits of Sesame Street were experienced by children across a wide variety of backgrounds. The authors also found that by 1990, Sesame Street was no longer "viewed more often by economically advantaged than disadvantaged children," so the benefits to children crossed class divisions (Rice and Huston...). As school districts are beginning to purchase tablets for use by all students, there is room for increased opportunity for all children within the district to experience any educational benefits of the technology leading to more even educational advancement by the residents of the area. However, even if this policy serves to improve equal access to opportunity in high and middle income areas, there is a severe risk that poorer districts will increasingly fall behind in regards to educational opportunity.
	In a recent review of a one laptop one student initiative for fourth and fifth graders in a California school district, researchers found that only students from at-risk backgrounds, which they defined as Hispanics and low-income households, made significant gains in English language skills (Zheng Warschauer...). This points to technology's potential as a great equalizer. The groups that benefited the most from the laptop program were also the group that were least likely to otherwise have access to the internet or other modern computing device. This points to a possible finding that technology is able to improve learning, but only to a point.
	 Going back to the study of educational television programming, the authors found diminishing returns on the benefits of increased exposure to the programming in both time spent per day/week as well as as the age of the child increased (Rice, Huston...). Together, these findings suggest that tablets are likely to provide some educational benefit however much like television are likely to have diminishing returns. 
	Parents and educators want only the best for their children and thus will continue to search for any method or philosophy that will provide maximum future benefit. However, history provides a shining example of technology's failure to provide a silver bullet that revolutionizes education. Microsoft's PowerPoint software was introduced in 1990 and was initially much welcomed for its ease of use and relative simplicity. Today, there is considerably controversy about the effectiveness of PowerPoint as a presentation tool. In a study comparing PowerPoint's effectiveness to the traditional lecture style, university students retained 15% less material from the PowerPoint assisted presentation. However, and with vital implications to the proposed study, they also strongly preferred the PowerPoint presentation to the traditional lecture (Savoy, Proctor...). This raises an important question, if the goal of a daycare provider or parent regarding early childhood education is primarily focused on building a thirst for learning than on specific achievements, then shouldn't educational technology be used if it encourages the child to enjoy learning more than the alternative.
	There is anecdotal and scholarly evidence of very young children intuitively understanding how to use the touchscreen to interact with the device as an extension of their regular environment (Couse & Chen, 2010; Matthews & Jessel, 1993). Children are able to easily navigate the touch interfaces of tablet devices, rapidly becoming more comfortable with the new technology than their parents. Because of their small size and weight, as well as the fast response to input, tablets are well suited for children to interact with as a part of their environment. During the past decade, tablets have become nearly ubiquitous. Recent surveys predict that nearly 200 million devices will be sold in 2015 (Gartner. Global sales of media tablets to end users from 2010 to 2016, by operating system (in million units). In Statista - The Statistics Portal. Retrieved March 10, 2015, from http://www.statista.com/statistics/272445/global-tablet-sales-forecast-by-operating-system/). It is difficult to argue that a child who lacks experience with tablet computers by the age of 5 will somehow be destined to a life of relative technological illiteracy compared to their more-experienced peers. The more significant discussion must be related to whether a tablet is an effective educational tool.
//Participants
	To study the effects of tablet computers and educational the proposed study would require recruiting preschool aged participants from a wide variety of cultural, social, and ethnic backgrounds. It is important that the children represent the range of educational attainment achieved by preschoolers. Additionally, they must have a wide variety of experiences interacting with technology.
	Ideally, participants with little to no experience with tablet computers could be recruited from both preschools in poor, urban areas where economics is the limiting factor on technology, and groups with stronger cultural aversions to children using computers where the choice not to introduce children to tablet computers is voluntary. Children should also be recruited from a range of geographic regions and countries.
	Because children are expected to be able to reliably count up to ten objects by the time they enter kindergarten and the experiment will require testing the children on a range of simple mathematics questions, the ideal age range of the children will be between the ages of four and five years.

//Conclusions



	To investigate the benefits of tablets and educational apps the study would involve a series of experiments where children in different conditions would be directed to play with a virtual and/or a physical educational tool. I can foresee conditions where children are directed to different types of educational activities, such as mathematics, vocabulary, or musical flashcards for example, via a virtual application or physical cards. The children would then take some kind of test to determine how well they learned the information presented. In addition, there should also be conditions where the child is allowed to spend as much time as they like preparing (or studying) to determine whether there is some preference, measured by time spent on the task, toward either kind of interaction.
	It is important that the test protocol not favor any input type condition. Thus, it may be reasonable to test children on the same or opposite method as their preparation. Alternatively, some other tool, verbal quizzing with drawings on a blackboard for instance, could alleviate some concerns about practice effects.
The study could turn up a variety of outcomes. 
•	Children could learn better from the tablet (or the reverse).
•	Children could learn more efficiently from the tablet but prefer to spend more time with the physical cards (or the reverse) so the results show similar total learning effectiveness.
	In addition, it is important to observe how children interact with the different input types. Do they like to spread flash cards around, thus incorporating some visual-spatial organization into their encoding of the knowledge. This is a limitation of electronic devices that could hamper their usefulness.
	One of the studies that I've looked at performed an ergonomic analysis of children using tablets. They found that while using the computer, the children tended to have poor posture, spinal alignment, and shoulder position. However, they noted that this position was similar to that that children assumed while playing with paper (Straker et al., 2008). 
	This study incorporates many concepts addressed in this course. For example, attention and memory are studied directly as well as other topics such as executive functioning and goal setting via the self-timed conditions.
